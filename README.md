# Putio Media Player
This is a small app for put.io . 

You can add a download URL and put.io will start transfer for that. Wait a couple of seconds and refresh the list, you should see the added file on the user interface -if it is a \*.mp4-. Select the file and push the play button. Expect bugs.

It depends on `putiopy` , `PySimpleGUI`  and `webbrowser` libraries. I wrote and tested the code with Python 3.7 on a `Macbook Pro - El Capitan`.

Feel free to copy and do whatever you want to with it.
